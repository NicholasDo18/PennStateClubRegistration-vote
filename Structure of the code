Explanation:
ClubMember class: Represents individual members of the club. Each member has a name, email, membership status, and a set to track the roles they've voted for.

ClubVoteRegistrationSystem class: Manages the voting registration system. It contains a dictionary to store members and their details, as well as poll results. The methods in this class handle member registration, eligibility verification, voting, and displaying poll results.

Main function: Serves as the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the ClubVoteRegistrationSystem class and presents a menu-driven interface for users to register, verify eligibility, vote, view poll results, or exit the program.

This structure allows for a clear separation of concerns, with the ClubVoteRegistrationSystem class handling the core functionality related to voting and member management, while the main function orchestrates user interaction.
